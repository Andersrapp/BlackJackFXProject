My second project in school for java development.
It builds on my previous project where I made a game of BlackJack. 
The course covered using Java FX and scene builder to create a well designed GUI.

Strengths:
- Nice layout

Possible improvements:
- Better picturing of playing cards.
- Server login

Techniques: Java SE, Java FX, Scene builder
